<h1>Adam’s Journey 🎮</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy named Adam. He loved an online game called Roblox more than anything else. He spent hours building worlds, scripting simple games, and imagining players exploring his creations.</p>

<p>But when Adam went to school, things were different. Some kids bullied him for liking Roblox. They said it was a waste of time and told him he would never make anything important.</p>

<p>Even though their words hurt, Adam didn’t give up. Deep down, he dreamed of becoming a game creator.</p>

<p>Adam’s biggest inspiration was a famous developer named Sammy, who had made the biggest video game in the world. Millions of people played it every day. Adam watched Sammy’s videos, studied his games, and told himself, “One day, I’ll be like him.”</p>

<p>Every night after homework, Adam practiced. He failed a lot, but each mistake taught him something new. Slowly, his games got better—and so did his confidence.</p>

<p>Adam knew that one day, the same people who laughed at him would be playing his game.</p>

<p>And this was only the beginning of his journey. 🚀</p>
